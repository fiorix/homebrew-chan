  # The app's Tauri updater owns upgrades via the darwin-aarch64 manifest at
  # https://chan.app/dl/desktop/latest.json; `brew upgrade` skips this cask
  # unless --greedy. Every GA still rewrites version and sha256 here, so a
  # fresh install or `brew reinstall` always gets the current DMG. The
  # one-or-the-other contract with the headless formula lives in caveats
  # only: cask conflicts_with cannot name a formula (the DSL accepts only
  # :cask), and there is no file-level clash because this cask installs no
  # bin shims. Only darwin-aarch64 artifacts are published, and Big Sur is
  # the bundle's minimumSystemVersion (desktop/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json).

  # No `binary` stanzas: the app installs self-healing ~/.local/bin/{chan,cs}
  # symlinks on every launch (desktop/src-tauri/src/cs_install.rs) and never
  # clobbers foreign files; a brew-managed shim would double-manage the same
  # two names.

  # ~/.local/bin/{chan,cs} are not zapped: the same paths may hold a real
  # binary from the standalone install.sh. ~/.chan is all Chan state, shared
  # with any CLI install.

  caveats <<~EOS
    Chan installs `chan` and `cs` shims into ~/.local/bin on first launch.
    The headless CLI formula (fiorix/chan/chan) provides the same commands;
    install one or the other, not both.
