# prebuilt-binary formula is fine in a personal tap (homebrew-core rules do
# not apply). The tarball asset name must match
# web/packages/marketing/scripts/release-assets.mjs (cliAssets).

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      The Chan Desktop cask (fiorix/chan/chan-desktop) provides the same
      `chan` and `cs` commands via ~/.local/bin; install one or the other.

      Prefer `brew upgrade chan` over `chan upgrade`: the self-updater
      replaces the binary in place and Homebrew's recorded version lags.
